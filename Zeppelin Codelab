# Cloud Dataproc Zeppelin Codelab

## Introduction

Apache Spark can be used for interactive data science -- not just batch
processing. This is a quick introduction to [Apache
Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/), which is a web-based interface for data
science. It supports Spark, Python, and even BigQuery. Today, we're going to run
through Zeppelin's builtin tutorial for Scala Spark and Spark SQL.

## Create a cluster

```bash
gcloud config set project <your-project>
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-f
gcloud config set compute/region us-central1
```

```bash
gcloud dataproc clusters create zeppelin --initialization-actions gs://dataproc-initialization-actions/zeppelin/zeppelin.sh
```

## Open the Zeppelin UI

Note: If you have any issues accessing the UI check the [Troubleshooting
section](#appendix-troubleshooting) or contact karthikpal@.

The
[instructions](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/cluster-web-interfaces)
vary by OS. Note that this is not supported on corp Chromebooks, which cannot be
configured to use a proxy other than UberProxy.

**On Linux (in two terminals)**:

Terminal 1:

```bash
gcloud compute ssh zeppelin-m --ssh-flag="-nND 1080"
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
/usr/bin/google-chrome --proxy-server="socks5://localhost:1080" --host-resolver-rules="MAP * 0.0.0.0 , EXCLUDE localhost" --user-data-dir=/tmp http://zeppelin-m:8080
```

**On Mac (in two terminals)**:

Terminal 1:

```bash
gcloud compute ssh zeppelin-m --ssh-flag="-nND 1080"
```

Terminal 2:

```
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --proxy-server="socks5://localhost:1080" --host-resolver-rules="MAP * 0.0.0.0 , EXCLUDE localhost" --user-data-dir=/tmp http://zeppelin-m:8080
```

If the previous commands succeeded, a new Chrome window should have popped up.
If not, see the Appendix below for debugging tips.

You will see this error until BeyondCorp is disabled. If you do not see the
error initially, you may see it when navigating to another page.

**You must disable BeyondCorp and set it to "Off: System/Alternative". This way,
Chrome will respect the SOCKS proxy we configured it to use.**

**You should now be able to view the Zeppelin UI!**

## Walk through builtin tutorial

![Click on tutorial](https://screenshot.googleplex.com/Cs7TgroWhHZ.png)

Click "Save" to enable all interpreters.

![Click Save](https://screenshot.googleplex.com/xzcX3KqMQrx.png)

Then, click the "play" button at the top to run the whole notebook. You can also
use the play button on a note to just re-run that note.

![Run notebook](https://screenshot.googleplex.com/D3ORfAtoMiF.png)

### Play with the charts

We can change the max age to 100 in the first chart. Change:

```
where age < 30
```

to

```
where age < 100
```

Then, hit the play button (on the note) to regenerate the graph.

![Max age 100 graph](https://screenshot.googleplex.com/oyi24DG2LjS.png)

We can also create a new chart by adding SQL code to the open text box at the
bottom. Copy and paste this code to generate a chart showing the marital status
of bank customers by age:

```
%sql
select age, marital, count(1) value
from bank
group by age, marital
order by age, marital
```

Here is what happens when we hit play:

The default bar chart isn't exactly what we want -- the axes are wrong:

![Bad chart](https://screenshot.googleplex.com/dBE8nfUb3N3.png)

We need to modify the chart's settings to get the axes we want:

Play around with the builtin charts to find a graph you like. I personally
prefer the "stacked" view:

### Modify the code

The tutorial downloads `bank.csv` from s3 by default. Let's copy it to your GCS
bucket. In a terminal (outside of Zeppelin), run these commands, replacing
`<YOUR-BUCKET>` with your GCS bucket:

```bash
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/apache-zeppelin/tutorial/bank/bank.csv
gsutil cp bank.csv gs://<YOUR-BUCKET>/bank.csv
```

Now, back in Zeppelin, replace these lines of code:

```scala
import org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils
import java.net.URL
import java.nio.charset.Charset

// Zeppelin creates and injects sc (SparkContext) and sqlContext (HiveContext or SqlContext)
// So you don't need create them manually

// load bank data
val bankText = sc.parallelize(
    IOUtils.toString(
        new URL("https://s3.amazonaws.com/apache-zeppelin/tutorial/bank/bank.csv"),
        Charset.forName("utf8")).split("\n"))
```

With (again replacing `<YOUR-BUCKET>`):

```scala
val bankText = sc.textFile("gs://<YOUR-BUCKET>/bank.csv")
```

Run the entire notebook with the "play" button at the top. All the charts should
still be the same.

![Notebook with first code
change](https://screenshot.googleplex.com/XHdK53wX9vf.png)

Newer versions of Spark can infer the schema and column names from CSV files. We
can actually replace all of the code in the first box with this:

```scala
val bank = spark.read
  .option("header", "true")
  .option("inferSchema", "true")
  .option("delimiter", ";")
  .csv("gs://<YOUR-BUCKET>/bank.csv")
bank.registerTempTable("bank")
```

Again, run the entire notebook with the "play" button at the top. All the charts
should still be the same.

![Notebook with second code
change](https://screenshot.googleplex.com/MfVi5V1zPdZ.png)

### Create a report

We're currently in the "default" (code editing) view. Switch to the "report"
view for a shiny report with just the graphs.

You could use Zeppelin as a replacement for Excel/Sheets!

## Clean up

Great -- you've probably:

*   Used Zeppelin for the first time
*   Used Spark for the first time
*   Used the Scala language for the first time

Feel free to continue exploring on your own!

*   [Use the BigQuery
    interpreter](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/latest/interpreter/bigquery.html)
*   [Write your own charts with
    Angular](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/latest/displaysystem/front-end-angular.html)
*   Try the "R" language and R Spark (Zeppelin home page -> R tutorial)

For now, let's delete our Dataproc cluster:

```bash
gcloud dataproc clusters delete zeppelin
```

## Appendix -- Troubleshooting

### Cannot ssh (password prompt)

```
$ gcloud compute ssh zeppelin --ssh-flag="-nND 1080"
Enter passphrase for key '/home/karthikpal/.ssh/google_compute_engine':
```

This means you earlier used `gcloud compute ssh` and set a passphrase on the key
it generated. If you don't remember the passphrase, just delete old key pair:

```bash
rm ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine*
```

Now, when you `gcloud compute ssh` it will prompt you for a password. Hit
`<enter>` to avoid setting a passphrase:

```
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/karthikpal/.ssh/google_compute_engine): [Press enter key]
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Press enter key]
Enter same passphrase again: [Press enter key]
Your identification has been saved in /home/karthikpal/.ssh/google_compute_engine.
Your public key has been saved in /home/karthikpal/.ssh/google_compute_engine.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
5f:ad:40:00:8a:d1:9b:99:b3:b0:f8:08:99:c3:ed:d3 foo@bar.com
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+

|         o. o.o  |
|          ..   . |

```

### "Open failed"

```
$ /usr/bin/google-chrome --proxy-server="socks5://localhost:1080" --host-resolver-rules="MAP * 0.0.0.0 , EXCLUDE localhost" --user-data-dir=/tmp http://zeppelin-m:8080
channel 15: open failed: administratively prohibited: open failed
channel 16: open failed: administratively prohibited: open failed
channel 17: open failed: administratively prohibited: open failed
```

This may or not be an issue -- it just indicates that Chrome could not load a
page that you navigated to. If you can see the Zeppelin UI, you can ignore this
error.

If you cannot view the Zeppelin UI:

*   Ensure that the ssh command to create a SOCKS proxy succeeded
*   Ensure that BeyondCorp is set to "Off: System/Alternative"
*   Ensure that you are viewing the right page (for this tutorial:
    `http://zeppelin-m:8080`)

### Could not find resource

```
$ gcloud compute ssh zeppelin --ssh-flag="-nND 1080"
ERROR: (gcloud.compute.ssh) Could not fetch resource:
 - The resource 'projects/google.com:hadoop-cloud-dev/zones/us-east1-d/instances/zeppelin' was not found
```

This indicates that the GCE instance specified in the command was not found. In
this example, I incorrectly used `zeppelin` (the Dataproc cluster name) instead
of `zeppelin-m` (the master GCE instance).

It is also possible that creating a Datparoc cluster failed. Type `gcloud
dataproc clusters describe zeppelin` to check its status. The output of
`describe` also contains the master instance name (which will be `${CLUSTER}-m`
for non-HA clusters).

### Operation timed out

```
$ gcloud compute ssh zeppelin --ssh-flag="-nND 1080"
ssh: connect to host <HOST_IP> port 22: Operation timed out
 ERROR: (gcloud.compute.ssh) [/usr/local/bin/ssh] exited with return code [255]
```

This indicates that the connection is not allowed by firewall rules. E.g., if
your project belongs to Google.com org, no ssh from external networks is allowed
by default (go/gce-enforcer). You can create a firewall rule for your IP (but
please be aware, firewall rules might be automatically deleted by a watchdog
that periodically checks all projects that belong to the Google-org):

```
IP=$(wget -qO - http://ipecho.net/plain; echo)
gcloud compute --project=YOUR_PROJECT firewall-rules create zeppelin-rules
  --direction=INGRESS --priority=1000 --network=default --action=ALLOW
  --rules=tcp:22 --source-ranges=$IP
```

An alternate solution is to [Chromote](http://go/chromote) into a workstation on
the corp network, then run the `ssh` and `google-chrome` commands from that
machine.

Note: using Cloudtop if you are outside the corp network will not work because
it is also bound by GCE Enforcer's firewall rules.
